What is StoredSheet?
====================

A spreadsheet-like interface to centralized data-tables.

StoredSheet (or stored_sheet) is a prototype for a system that 
lets users create tables of data as easily as they would in a spreadsheet program (such as Excel)
but stores the information in a central repository.
