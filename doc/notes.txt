so, as  the user types into the cells in turn,
each cell
    is marked as dirty
    its new contents get ajaxed up to the server
    it gets marked as clean or problem based on ajax result

dirty/problem indicators
    cells - background color
    main indicator at top (like google spreadsheets)
        dirty = active Save button
            means need to be able to save all cells/all dirty cells at once
            maybe the queue can batch cell changes together
                maybe that's too complicated for first version and we'll just send one or all
        problem = error info region
            displays error message(s)
            retry button
            report button?
                really should have auto error reporting
                may make them feel better
                can they judge whether a retry is likely to work? maybe not...
        edit to cell B46 (change "old value" to "new value") failed: "Error message" - Retry Revert
