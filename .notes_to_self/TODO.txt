fix basic ui
   fix fontsize problem when editing cell
   add keyboard options for cell editing movement
   add row
      by button
      by using neighboring cell
   add column
      by button
      by using neighboring cell
   add row headers
   remove click-to-sort from column headers
   move the save button to a more useful spot
   autosave periodically

stage two ui
   special case the first row to name the columns
   add a sortby interface
   perhaps add column data type choosers


deal with multiple editors
