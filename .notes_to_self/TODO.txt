fix basic ui
   fix fontsize problem when editing cell
   add keyboard options for cell editing movement
   add row
      by button
      by using neighboring cell
   add column
      by button
      by using neighboring cell
   add row headers
   remove click-to-sort from column headers
   move the save button to a more useful spot
   autosave periodically

stage two ui
   special case the first row to name the columns
   add a sortby interface
   perhaps add column data type choosers

separate data from grid layout
   motivator: so adding columns in the middle doesn't require renaming half the fields

import/export
   import csv
   download as csv

deal with multiple editors
   versioning/merging changes
   cell by cell saves?



?maybe merge in some ideas from slickback
